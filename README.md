# marioGame

This is a recreation of the original super mario game, of level 1-1. 
An adult sized mario bounces around the screen while a mushroom powerup also bounces around. 
The mushroom can make him grow to adult size, or if he is already adult sized, he will get a cool white suit.
A goomba roams the ground and multiple bullet bills roam the skies; if white-suited mario hits the goomba or bullet bill, mario will lose his suit and become a regular adult sized mario. 
If adult sized mario hits the goomba or bullet bill, mario will become child-sized mario. If child-sized mario hits the goomba or bullet bill, mario will die and the game will end.
